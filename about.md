<font color="2569A1">Research Interests</font>

My research examines the relationships between atomic order, microstructure, and functional properties within inorganic material systems. I am particularly interested
in applying multiscale modeling to outstanding problems in magnetism, piezoelectricity, and plasticity. My expertise spans atomistic simulations, including density functional 
theory and molecular dynamics, as well as phase-field calculations at the mesocale. I also enjoy code development. I currently contribute to the development and maintenence of a 
C++ based software designed to predict the motion and interactions of crystal dislocations within a phase-field framework.
