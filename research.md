<font color="2569A1">Modeling at the atomic scale</font>

I use both density functional theory and molecular statics/dynamics to explore the influence of atomic interactions on the mechanical and functional properties of inorganic material systems. I am particularly interested in the tradeoffs that are a direct consequence of choosing one of these modeling approaches over the other. For example, the interatomic potentials often employed in molecular statics allow for the motion of millions of atoms to be considered, but, in turn, the atoms are assumed to behave classically. Alternatively, density functional theory relaxes a material system's atomic configuration by calculating the material's wavefunction. But, of course, this comes at the expense of needing to diagonalize matrices that can become quite large! The blog posts included on this site should provide some insight into what can beachieved with different state-of-the-art softwares like VASP (plane-wave based density functional theory), DFT-FE (finite-element-based density functional theory), and LAMMPS (molecular statics/dynamics).

Phase-field methods have proven to be a promising approach to predicting the behavior of materials at lengthscales of a micron or larger. I find phase-field methods to be a very powerful tool for performing calculations on material systems that may have several distinct order parameters, potentially associated with very different macroscopic properties, active at once. A current goal of mine is to develop robust software for the coupling between charge and plasticity in ionic crystals.
