Hello! Welcome to my new site. Considering I have graduated from UC Santa Barbara I felt it was time to move my website off of their network. I also thought this would a good excuse for ``beefing up'' my site as well. I'm hoping to make this a place where I can informally share problems that I am working on. Please do not hesistate to reach out if you have questions or ideas that you would like to discuss. Cheers!
